# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Architecture

Two services with a clear split of responsibility:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `agent-service/` | FastAPI. Runs the seven agents, owns the SQLite schedule/results database, serves the built React app. |
| `backend/` | Spring Boot gateway. Orchestrates the agents, **owns the weighted vote**, persists predictions to Postgres, caches in Redis. |
| `demo/` | React 19 + Tailwind dashboard. Built into the Python image at Docker stage 1. |
| `mobile-app/` | Empty placeholder for the planned React Native app. |
| `database/init.sql` | PostgreSQL seed — 32 teams with fixed IDs. |

The Python service runs the agents; the Java gateway decides what their output means. That
split is deliberate: agent weights live in Postgres and can be recalibrated without a redeploy,
and every prediction is recorded so accuracy can be measured continuously.

**Deployment note:** the Railway deploy still runs only the Python service (root `Dockerfile`
builds React into it, `railway.json` runs `python main.py`), and `demo/src/App.js` hardcodes the
Railway URL, calling FastAPI directly. The gateway is wired into `docker-compose.yml` and works
locally, but is not yet in the hosted deploy.

## Commands

```bash
# Full stack: postgres + redis + agent service + gateway
docker-compose up -d

# Agent service alone (serves API + frontend if demo/build exists)
cd agent-service && python main.py            # → :8001

# Gateway alone (needs postgres + redis)
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run          # → :8080

# Tests
cd agent-service && python -m pytest tests/ -q
cd backend && ./mvnw compile

# Backtest
cd agent-service && python backtest.py --season 2025 --runs 10
cd agent-service && python backtest.py --season 2025 --runs 10 --method majority

# Load schedule data
cd agent-service && python utils/schedule_loader.py --seasons 2021-2025
```

Java 17 is the target. `mvn` is not installed — use `./mvnw`, and set
`JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)` if the default JDK is older.

## The agents

All in `agent-service/agents/`, each exposing `async get_status()`, `async refresh()`, and
`async predict_game(game_data, game_context)` returning `{winner, confidence, reasoning}`.

| Agent | Accuracy (2021-24) | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `basic_predictor.py` | 62.1% | 0.121 | ESPN records → PFR → sportsdata.io fallback chain |
| `elo_agent.py` | 61.5% | 0.115 | Ratings from `utils/elo.py`, no network calls |
| `rest_travel_agent.py` | 52.2% | 0.022 | Schedule situation via `utils/venues.py` |
| `weather_agent.py` | 51.1% | 0.011 | Open-Meteo → WeatherAPI → NOAA |
| `news_sentiment_agent.py` | 49.7% | 0.0 | RSS keyword sentiment; no measurable edge |
| `odds_agent.py` | not backtestable | 0.02 | Needs `ODDS_API_KEY`; inert without one |
| `injury_agent.py` | not backtestable | 0.02 | ESPN league-wide injury endpoint |

Elo's 61.5% understates it — 2021 is a cold start since the game log begins there. From 2022 on
it averages 63.8%.

**Two agents have never been measured.** The free odds tier serves current lines only and ESPN
publishes no historical injury archive, so neither can be backtested. Both sit at
`DEFAULT_WEIGHT` (0.02). Market Odds is very likely worth more, but do not raise it on intuition
— the gateway records live predictions precisely so it can be calibrated from data.

## Consensus — read before touching

`agents/consensus.py` is the single source of truth for voting in Python; `ConsensusService.java`
mirrors it for live traffic. `main.py` and `backtest.py` both call `build_consensus`, so measured
accuracy reflects the code that serves predictions. **Do not inline voting logic into either
caller.**

Weighted method (default): each agent contributes `weight × (confidence − 0.5)` to its pick.
Consequences worth knowing:

- An agent with no data should return confidence **exactly 0.50**, not a guess. That contributes
  zero without injecting noise. `odds_agent` and `injury_agent` both do this.
- Weights are the measured edge over a coin flip, floored at zero. An agent that cannot beat 50%
  literally cannot swing a prediction.
- Re-derive weights from `backtest.py` output; the Java copy reads them from the `agent_weights`
  table, seeded by `config/AgentWeightSeeder.java`.

**Historical bug, fixed:** the original counter only handled N-0 and (N-1)-1 splits and fell
through to "most confident agent wins" for everything else. Invisible with exactly four agents
(4-0, 3-1, 2-2 are the only splits), but it discarded the majority on a 3-2 split the moment a
fifth agent appeared. Any change here needs testing at N ≥ 5.

## Measured accuracy

Walk-forward backtest, weights fitted on 2021-2024 (2025 is out-of-sample):

| Season | Equal-weight (old) | Weighted (current) | Best single agent |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 2021 | 57.2% | 59.6% | 59.2% |
| 2022 | 59.6% | 62.4% | 63.1% |
| 2023 | 60.0% | 63.1% | 62.9% |
| 2024 | 61.7% | 67.4% | 69.1% |
| 2025 | 62.3% | 66.5% | 66.9% |
| Mean | 60.2% | **63.8%** | 63.1% |

Weighted voting is worth +3.6 points over equal-weight and now beats the best single component
in 4 of 5 seasons (equal-weight lost in all 5). Predictions are deterministic — zero-weight
agents cannot perturb the result.

## Backtest discipline

`backtest.py` enforces point-in-time correctness. Preserve these properties in any change:

- Team stats come from a rolling 17-game window of games that kicked off **before** the game
  being predicted. The live ESPN endpoint is never called — it returns current standings and
  would leak the season under test.
- Elo records pre-kickoff ratings during `build()`, so building through the tested season is
  still point-in-time.
- Weather uses seasonal simulation keyed to the game's real month, never today's conditions.
- News runs in simulated-scenario mode (RSS carries today's headlines).
- Odds and injuries run as `InertAgent` — using today's data for a 2025 game is an anachronism.
  They report ~53.7% in the per-agent table purely because they always name the home team; the
  report flags them `[inert]`.

## Data layer

- **`agent-service/nfl_schedule.db`** (SQLite, committed) — the `games` table: schedule, venue,
  final scores, playoff seeds/rounds. 2021-2025. `espn_game_id` has a UNIQUE index and
  `_store_games()` upserts on it. This is what the agents and backtest read.
- **PostgreSQL** — `teams` (from `init.sql`), plus `agent_weights` and `predictions` created by
  JPA. Only the gateway touches it.
- **Redis** — `gamePredictions` (30 min TTL) and `agentWeights` (24 h). Falls back to an
  in-memory cache when `spring.cache.type=simple`, which is the local default.

`NFLScheduleLoader.__init__` runs DDL and a dedupe DELETE on every instantiation, so importing
`main.py` mutates the SQLite file. Expect it to show as modified in `git status`.

## Gotchas

- **Path traversal in the SPA catch-all.** `main.py` `/{full_path:path}` joins unsanitized user
  input onto `demo_build` and returns it as a `FileResponse`. Encoded `../` can escape the build
  directory. **Still unfixed.**
- **Playoff rounds reuse week numbers 1-4.** `/games/week/{week}` now filters on `season_type`
  (default `regular`) for exactly this reason — without it, week 1 returned the season opener
  *and* the Wild Card round, 22 games instead of 16. Keep that filter.
- **The playoff simulator doesn't propagate a bracket.** `/playoffs/{season}/simulate` flips a
  seed-gap-weighted coin on each round's *stored* matchups independently; winners never advance
  and the agents aren't involved. Only meaningful for seasons already played.
- **`weather_agent.predict_game` overwrites `home_team`** from
  `game_context['home_team_stats']['team']` and `KeyError`s if the context is incomplete. It also
  ignores `game_data.venue` in favor of the `TEAM_TO_VENUE` lookup. `utils/venues.py` is the
  complete table (domes included); the weather agent's own is missing dome coordinates.
- **Odds API quota** is 500 requests/month on the free tier. `OddsClient` fetches all games in
  one request and caches 30 min. Do not make it per-game.
- **Docker Hub withdrew the `openjdk` images.** `backend/Dockerfile` uses `eclipse-temurin`.
- **One known-failing test**: `test_analyze_team_sentiment_fallback` asserts `article_count == 0`
  but the collector's fallback payload carries 2 headlines. Pre-existing.

## Conventions

- Agents are plain classes, not a framework. Register new ones in `main.py`'s module-level agent
  block, in `_run_all_agents`, and add a weight entry in both `consensus.py` and
  `AgentWeightSeeder.java`.
- `game_data` is duck-typed — agents read `.home_team_name`, `.away_team_name`, `.game_id`,
  `.venue`, `.is_dome`, `.game_time`. `backtest.py::GameStub` relies on this.
- Point-in-time overrides go through a `game_id`-keyed dict on the agent (`pregame_ratings`,
  `pregame_rest`), never by mutating shared state — the backtest runs 12 games concurrently and
  mutation would race.
- Every external call has a fallback and returns a `source` field recording which path was taken.
